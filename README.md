# Angkor-Warrior
## 2D Platformer Game

Step into the shoes of an ancient warrior from the Khmer Empire in Angkor Warrior, a 2D platformer set in the majestic and historical Angkor Era. Traverse through stunning pixel-art landscapes, from dense jungles to the iconic temples of Angkor Wat, battling mythical creatures, and uncovering hidden secrets of the empire.

As the last hope of a fallen kingdom, you must harness the ancient power of the gods and confront enemies inspired by the legendary folklore of the Khmer Empire. With each level, you'll explore ruins, evade treacherous traps, and face fierce guardians as you embark on a quest to restore balance to the once-thriving civilization.

Can you reclaim the glory of the empire and become the true Angkor Warrior?
